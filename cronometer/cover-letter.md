Hey Aaron,

I am excited to apply for the Director of Software Engineering position at Cronometer. As someone who has called Revelstoke home for 16 years, I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to help guide Cronometer through its pivotal growth phase while preserving the amazing work culture and fun roots that make this company so special.

During my tenure at Mozilla Foundation, I successfully navigated a similar growth challenge, leading the engineering organization as the company scaled from a handful of employees to over 100, empowering thousands of volunteers and contributors to further the Foundationâ€™s mission. Recognizing that we couldn't compete with industry giants for expensive senior talent, I developed a comprehensive mentorship-driven growth strategy that transformed university-level developers into experienced, high-performing engineers. This approach included structured paired mentoring systems, weekly company-wide demos, transforming code reviews into teaching moments, and implementing progressive development paths from "shadowing to leading." The results were remarkable: near-100% team retention, increased cross-team collaboration, and a self-sustaining mentorship culture where formerly junior developers became mentors themselves. This experience has prepared me to help Cronometer's 18 engineers across three teams maintain their collaborative excellence while scaling effectively.

My strategic approach to engineering leadership focuses on data-driven decision making and sustainable growth practices. At Adobe, where I currently lead product management for developer experience for our 13K+ developers, I've implemented DORA metrics, the SPACE framework, and innovative approaches like micro-surveys triggered by pull request submissions to gather evergreen, real-time feedback on the engineering experience. I regularly work with our CFO and present to our CEO on our AI tooling strategy. I have overseen large-scale studies that evaluate individual outputs and convert engineering productivity gains into estimated NPV calculations. I have a depth of experience in managing technical debt. I apply the same principles as financial debt management, maintaining a strategic balance where we consistently "service" technical debt based on velocity trends, ensuring teams remain flexible and productive. This balanced approach to immediate deliverables versus long-term technical investments is exactly what Cronometer needs to maintain engineering excellence during growth.

My experience spans the full spectrum of what this role demands: from fostering engineering culture, maturing teams with accountability practices and structured retrospectives, to breaking down silos through empathy-building activities. My background includes significant experience with managing legacy systems, security and risk management, and staying competitive through innovation, including current work on cutting-edge AI integration for developer productivity.

I deeply understand and appreciate the unique balance of professional excellence and lifestyle that this community offers. The opportunity to help Cronometer maintain its fun, collaborative culture while building high-performing teams that reach millions of users represents exactly the kind of impactful work I'm passionate about. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in engineering leadership, mentorship-driven team building, and strategic technical planning can contribute to Cronometer's continued success in this beautiful mountain setting we all call home.

Sincerely,  
Simon Wex
